## Prerequisites
This extension operates with TF API provided by Microsoft. So, you need either
1. Have Visual Studio IDE installed
or
2. TeamExplorerEverywhere installed (https://github.com/Microsoft/team-explorer-everywhere)
> **Note:** Possibly, some other 3rd party tools would also work, if they provide the same output and receives the same commands / args

> **Note (for TeamExplorerEverywhere):** Possibly, works under Linux-based systems and MacOS, but I have no ability to test it

## Additional Prerequisites
- Extension would only work for a workspace already mapped on TFS (Preferably mapped as Server workspace).  
- Visual Studio Code - Minimum version requried for extension is 1.58.2.  

## Installation

1. Open up VS Code
2. Type **`F1`**
3. Type `ext` in command palette.
4. Select `Extensions: Install Extension` and hit **`ENTER`**
5. Type `auto-tfs`
6. Select **`Auto TFS`** extension and hit **`ENTER`**

## Configuration

A full path to TF tool should be specified in Settings (**File > Preferences > Settings**). (Recommended to configure in Workspace settings)  
The following entry is needed:

```
    "auto-tfs.tf.path": "<path-to-tf-command-line>"
```

If you are going to use the `tf.exe` tool embedded into Visual Studio IDE, the value to specify will be similar to `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\Common7\\IDE\\TF.exe`.  
Recent versions of Visual Studio has changed this path, here is a sample of Visual Studio 2019 (Professional) - `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Professional\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\TeamFoundation\\Team Explorer\\TF.exe`.  
For TEE, it will be like this: `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\TeamExplorerEverywhere\\tf.cmd`  

Another supported setting serves for logging information into Output. To enable this, just add following option to VS Code Settings:
```
    "auto-tfs.debug": true
```

## Usage
1. Invoke the command bar (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Start typing some of the command listed below or just Auto TFS. The full names of commands:
```
Auto TFS: Checkout current file
Auto TFS: Undo changes for current file
Auto TFS: Add current file to TFS
Auto TFS: Delete current file
```

Additionally, for ease of use you can configure the extension to support below functionalities â€“
- Configurable Automatic operations.
- Configurable confirmation of automatic operations.
- Auto Checkout on Save
- Auto Checkout on Change
- Auto Add to source control on Add
- Auto Delete from source control on Delete
- Auto Rename on source control on Rename (Experimental - works but throws exception)
- Add, Checkout and Undo operation can be performed via context menu in Explorer (multiple), Editor and Editor Tile.

## Features

## Available commands

* Add (a file should be saved first in the folder, which is included into mappings in TFS)
* Checkout
* Undo
* Delete
